# Project read/write out of processor

First write a sentence into the processor afther that show the text (readable) again by reading it from the processor.
Everything about the writing works (see other files before the final one Bonne_Robbe_opdrachtRead_Write.cpp).
With the final file were i'm reading a word out of the processor, it says "failed to read from the i2c device".
I asked Elias & Daan to check what's wrong but we could not find the problem.
